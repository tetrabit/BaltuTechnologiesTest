            After the cleanup, in-scope resources are no longer protected by web ACLs in this

            by tags that you create and accounts that you associate with the policy. When creating
            the policy, if you specify that only resources in specific accounts or with specific
            tags are in scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are handled by the policy.
            All others are out of scope. If you don't specify tags or accounts, all resources
            are in scope.

            The resource tags that AWS Firewall Manager uses to determine if a particular resource
            should be included or excluded from the AWS Firewall Manager policy. Tags enable you
            to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner,
            or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Firewall Manager
            combines the tags with "AND" so that, if you add more than one tag to a policy scope,
            a resource must have all the specified tags to be included or excluded. For more information,
            see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html">Working
